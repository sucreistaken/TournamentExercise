# TournamentExercise
Consider the tournaments in any area of sports.
Exercise 6.A (Inheritance, Composition)
To begin, consider only the following area of sports: basketball, and soccer.
Every tournament has teams to challenge among each other. A team has players to help them
each other. All players have common attributes and behaviours. Depending on his/her area of
expertise, special players have extra members.
First of all, design a concrete Player hierarchy where BasketballPlayer and SoccerPlayer are
derived from Player. Then, design a Team that has a list of players. After all, try to
implement different tournaments using randomly assigned teams in particular sport areas.
Exercise 6.B (Inheritance)
Modify your design in the following way: Consider an abstract class Player and redesign
your Player hierarchy including a few more areas of sports.
Exercise 6.C (Inheritance, Polymorphism)
Expand your design in the following way: Consider an interface EligibleSkillsToPerform
that must be implemented by all concrete subclasses of abstract base class Player.
